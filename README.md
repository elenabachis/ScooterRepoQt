With the help of Qt and C++ I helped design a GUI for a Scooter Shop which can list all scooters in a table and sort by columns.

The user can select a scooter from the list to see the attributes in a detailed view. 

The GUI allows the user to select the CSV file that serves as the database. From this 
the list of scooters is to be loaded.
